<h1>CodingFiction Content Policy</h1>
<p>CodingFiction is a free service for self-expression and communication. We believe Blogger increases the availability of information, encourages healthy debate, and makes possible new connections between people. It is our belief that censoring this content is contrary to a service that bases itself on freedom of expression.</p>
<p>However, in order to uphold these values, we need to curb abuses that threaten our ability to provide this service and the freedom of expression it encourages. As a result, there are some boundaries on the type of content that can be hosted with CodingFiction. The boundaries we&#39;ve defined are those that both comply with legal requirements and that serve to enhance the service as a whole.</p>
<p>We rely on blog readers to report content that they find inconsistent with Blogger&#39;s Community Guidelines. If you encounter a post that you believe violates Community Guidelines, please report it using the &#39;Report&#39; link located in the navigation of most blogs. If you are unable to find the link on the blog, you can still <a target="_blank" href="./go/report-abuse" rel="noopener">report suspected violations here.</a>.</p>
<h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
<p>Our community guidelines play an important role in keeping the open web a welcoming place to create. Please respect these guidelines. We may update our policies from time to time, so please check back here. Note that when applying the policies below, we may make exceptions based on artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific considerations or where there are other substantial benefits to the public from not taking action on the content.</p>
<div class="contents-depth3"><p><strong>Adult Content:</strong> We do allow adult content on Blogger, including images or videos that contain nudity or sexual activity. If your blog contains adult content, please mark it as &#39;adult&#39; in your Blogger settings. We may also mark blogs with adult content where the owners have not. All blogs marked as &#39;adult&#39; will be placed behind an &#39;adult content&#39; warning interstitial. If your blog has a warning interstitial, please do not attempt to circumvent or disable the interstitial - it is for everyone&rsquo;s protection.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to our adult content policy:</p> <ul><li>Do not use Blogger as a way to make money on adult content. For example, don&#39;t create blogs that contain ads for or links to commercial porn sites.</li> <li>We do not allow illegal sexual content, including image, video or textual content that depicts or encourages rape, incest, bestiality, or necrophilia.</li> <li>Do not post or distribute private nude, sexually explicit, or non-explicit intimate and sexual images or videos without the subject&rsquo;s consent. If someone has posted a private nude, sexually explicit, or non-explicit intimate and sexual image or video of you, please report it to us <a target="_blank" href="./go/report-private-image">here</a>.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Child safety:</strong> We have a zero-tolerance policy towards content that exploits children. Some examples of this include:</p> <ul><li><strong>Child sexual abuse imagery:</strong> We will terminate the accounts of any user we find publishing or distributing child sexual abuse imagery. We will also report that user to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, as required by law.</li> <li><strong>Pedophilia:</strong> We do not allow content that encourages or promotes sexual attraction towards children. For example, do not create blogs with galleries of images of children where the collection of images or text accompanying the images is sexually suggestive, and do not publish content of a sexual nature involving an underage participant.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Hate Speech:</strong> Our products are platforms for free expression, but we don&rsquo;t permit hate speech. Hate speech is content that promotes or condones violence against or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against an individual or group on the basis of their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization.</p>
<p><strong>Violence:</strong> It&#39;s not okay to post violent or gory content that&#39;s primarily intended to be shocking, sensational, or gratuitous. If posting graphic content in a news, documentary, scientific, or artistic context, please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand what&#39;s going on. In some cases, content may be so violent or shocking that no amount of context will allow that content to remain on our platforms. Lastly, don&#39;t encourage others to commit specific acts of violence.</p>
<p><strong>Terrorist Content:</strong> We do not permit terrorist organizations to use Blogger for any purpose, including recruitment. Blogger also strictly prohibits content related to terrorism, such as content that promotes terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist attacks.</p> <p>If posting content related to terrorism for an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic purpose, be mindful to provide enough information so viewers understand the context. Graphic or controversial footage may be subject to age-restrictions or a warning screen.</p>
<p><strong>Harassment and Threats:</strong> Do not harass or bully others. Anyone using Blogger to harass or bully may have the offending content removed or be permanently banned from the site. Online harassment is also illegal in many places and can have serious offline consequences. Don&#39;t threaten other people on your blog. For example, don&#39;t post death threats against another person or group of people and don&#39;t post content encouraging your readers to take violent action against another person or group of people.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright:</strong> It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. More information about our copyright procedures can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/blogger_dmca.html">here</a>. Also, please don&#39;t provide links to sites where your readers can obtain unauthorized downloads of other people&#39;s content.</p>
<p><strong>Personal and confidential information:</strong> It&#39;s not ok to publish another person&#39;s personal and confidential information. For example, don&#39;t post someone else&#39;s credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, unlisted phone numbers, and driver&#39;s license numbers. In addition, do not post or distribute images or videos of minors without the necessary consent from their legal representatives. If someone has posted an image or video of a minor without necessary consent, please report it to us <a href="./go/report-minor-image">here</a>. Also, please keep in mind that in most cases, information that is already available elsewhere on the Internet or in public records is not considered to be private or confidential under our policies.</p>
<p><strong>Impersonation and misrepresentation of identity:</strong> Do not impersonate a person or organization or misrepresent yourself.<br> This includes impersonating any person or organizations you don&#39;t represent; providing misleading information about a user/site&#39;s identity, qualifications, ownership, purpose, products, services, or business; or falsely implying affiliation with, or endorsement by, another individual or organization.<br> This also includes content or accounts misrepresenting or concealing their ownership or primary purpose such as misrepresenting or intentionally concealing your country of origin or other material details about yourself when directing content about politics, social issues, or matters of public concern to users in a country other than your own. We do allow parody, satire, and the use of pseudonyms or pen names - just avoid content that is likely to mislead your audience about your true identity.</p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Do not distribute content that deceives, misleads, or confuses users. This includes:</p> <p><i>Misleading content related to civic and democratic processes:</i> content that is demonstrably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in civic or democratic processes. This includes information about public voting procedures, political candidate eligibility based on age / birthplace, election results, or census participation that contradicts official government records. It also includes incorrect claims that a political figure or government official has died, been involved in an accident, or is suffering from a sudden serious illness.</p> <p><i>Misleading content related to harmful health practices:</i> misleading health or medical content that promotes or encourages others to engage in practices that may lead to serious physical or emotional harm to individuals, or serious public health harm.</p> <p><i>Manipulated media:</i> media that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm.</p> <p>Misleading content may be allowed in an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context, but please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand this context. In some cases, no amount of context will allow this content to remain on our platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous and Illegal activities:</strong> Do not use Blogger to engage in illegal activities or to promote dangerous and illegal activities. For example, don&#39;t author a blog encouraging people to drink and drive. Please also do not use Blogger to sell or promote illegal drugs. Otherwise, we may delete your content. Also, in serious cases such as those involving the abuse of children, we may report you to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Regulated Goods and Services:</strong> Do not use Blogger to sell or facilitate the sale of regulated goods and services, such as alcohol, gambling, pharmaceuticals and unapproved supplements, tobacco, fireworks, weapons, or health/medical devices.</p>
<p><strong>Spam:</strong> Spam takes several forms in Blogger, all of which can result in deletion of your account or blog. Some examples include creating blogs designed to drive traffic to your site or to move it up in search listings, posting comments on other people&#39;s blogs just to promote your site or product, and scraping existing content from other sources for the primary purpose of generating revenue or other personal gains.</p>
<p><strong>Malware and viruses:</strong> Do not create blogs that transmit viruses, cause pop-ups, attempt to install software without the reader&#39;s consent, or otherwise impact readers with malicious code. This is strictly forbidden on Blogger.</p></div>
